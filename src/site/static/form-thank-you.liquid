Netlify Forms don't play nice with serverless form endpoints,
so this page must be statically generated.  Hence, this 
client-side JS to get the back link customized for each
campaign.

<script>
function setBackLink() {
  params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  if (params.has("campaign")) {
    let backLink = document.getElementById("back-link");
    backLink.setAttribute(
      "href", backLink.getAttribute("href") + params.get("campaign"));
  }
}

setBackLink();
</script>
